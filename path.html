        <div><br><br>In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a roadway. He then hid himself and watched to see if anyone would move the boulder out of the way. Some of the kingâ€™s wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it.<br><br>Many people loudly blamed the King for not keeping the roads clear, but none of them did anything about getting the stone out of the way.<br><br>A peasant then came along carrying a load of vegetables. Upon approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to push the stone out of the road. After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded.<br><br>After the peasant went back to pick up his vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been.<br><br>The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the King explaining that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway.<br><br>Moral: Every obstacle we come across in life gives us an opportunity to improve our circumstances, and whilst the lazy complain, the others are creating opportunities through their kind hearts, generosity, and willingness to get things done.</div>
